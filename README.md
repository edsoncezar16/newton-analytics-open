# Projeto Newton Analytics

## Context

While I was trying to achieve my career transition from Physics to Data Engineering, I worked at "Projeto Newton" at the Federal University of Par√°, for the sake of paying bills. I did not know I would find an excellent workgroup and opportunities to apply my knowledge of data engineering and analytics there, due to the confidence and good relationship I built with Marcel Bertolini, then the current project coordinator.

The purpose of the project was to assist the student's engagement and performance in the disciplines of Calculus 1 and 2, whose importance for any STEM discipline can not be overestimated. However, our team did not know the actual impact the project had on the student's performance. We relied only on our perception and some student's testimony - which, to be honest, were not all positive.

However, I knew that the project coordination had historical data about project activities and student results. Then, Prof. Marcel asked me if we could leverage these data to answer these fundamental questions for the very purpose of the project itself in an assertive manner. We then set up a meeting and discussed exactly which questions we would like to ask, which metrics we would create to translate that business problem into an analytics one, and what would be deliverable at the end of the process.

## Results and Impact

* A data app built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) so that it can be easily shared with the project coordination and working members.

* Students who engage in the project activities have an average grade twice as great as those who do not.

* Helps increase future student engagement in the project activities.

* Provides a decisive argument in future financial aid for the project, as having an easily accessible, data-driven result in a meeting for deciding funding has to be considered an asset of substantial value.

## TODO

- [ ] Documentation.
- [ ] Improve design pattern for ease of maintenance.
